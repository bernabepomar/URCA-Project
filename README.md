## Introduction

The *Unmanned Radio Controlled Aircraft* Project is my first contact with creating a full aircraft from scratch. Designing absolutely everything: from the fuselage to the electronics to the code, my objective is to learn as much as possible about airplanes, building things and gain experience for future projects.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still a work in progress. Therefore, most progress will not be shown as it's not finished yet. 

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to make a (practically) fully **3D printed multitask UAV**. The final design will have different swappable models to make the UAV useful for a range of different applications. For this, it is essential for the design to be optimized for **efficiency**. 
### First design
The first design's objective is to understand the design and fabrication process of the UAV. As well as concetrating on making the pieces interchangeable to already start with a **modular design**. At last, efficiency is a factor that is already being taken into account not only in the design of the aircraft itself but also on the printing techniques and material choices.

## Design Process
Design starts with the use of XFLR5 to create a wing design and weight distribution that is stable and will fly correctly. 
### Wing
For the airfoil, I chose to use the [NACA 4412](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=naca4412-il), widely used in gliders because of it's efficiency and low speed needs for lift generation
